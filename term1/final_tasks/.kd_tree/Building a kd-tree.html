<h1>Building a kd-tree</h1>


In this assignment the goal is to build and visualize a kd-tree for a
set of points in the plane.  To manage complexity we'll split it in three parts: 
<ol>
<li>Part 1: build the kd-tree.
</li><li>Part 2: render/visualize the kd-tree.
</li><li>Part 3: make it look like a Mondrian painting.
</li></ol>

Starting code is available <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs3250-CompGeom/spring14/Code/kdtree-startup/">here</a>.

<h2>Part 1: Building the kd-tree</h2>

<p>First you will need to define a data structure to encode a
kd-tree such as below --- feel free to refine as needed.

</p><pre>typedef struct _treeNode treeNode;

struct _treeNode {
     point2D p; /* If this is a leaf node,  p represents the point stored in this leaf. 
                  If this is not a leaf node,  p represents the horizontal or vertical line
                  stored in this node. For a vertical line, p.y is
                  ignored. For a horizontal line, p.x is ignored
                */
     char type; / * this can be 'h' (horizontal) or 'v' (vertical), or 'l' (leaf)
                    depending whether the node splits with a horizontal line or  vertical line.
                    Technically this should be an enum.
                */
     treeNode  *left, *right; /* left/below and right/above children. */
}

typedef struct _kdtree{
   treeNode* root; 

   int count; //number of nodes  in the tree

   int height; //height of tree
} kdtree; 
</pre>




<p>You'll need to write the basic primitives for operating on a treeNode and
on a kdtree, such as creating a node and creating an empty tree, printing a
node, and printing a tree.


</p><p> For example, include a function that prints some basic info about the kd-tree,
such as number of nodes, and height. Call this function in the main
functin so that we can see its output. 
</p><pre>void kdtree_print(kdtree* t);
</pre> 

The main function that you will write for Part 1 is building a kd-tree from
a set of points. You will write a function to build and return a kd-tree as
follows: 

<pre>/* Build a kd-tree for the set of n points, where each leaf cell
   contains  1 point. 
   Return a pointer to the root.
*/
treeNode*  kdtree_build(point2D* points, int n)
</pre>

The function takes as input the set of points and returns the kd-tree.

<ul>

<li>To simplify dealing with coincident points, the first step in this
function should be to call a helper function that removes coincident points. 

<pre>int ndp; //number of dictinct points //this should be made a global same as n

ndp = remove_coincident_points(points,n); //ndp is smaller or equal to n
</pre>

<p>This helper function should remove the coincident points in
<tt>points</tt> and return the number of dictinct points. One way it can do
this is by sorting <tt>points</tt> and then in a subsequent pass shifting things left when equal. Basically the array <tt>points</tt> will stay the same, just that the <tt>ndp</tt> elements of it that are distinct will appear at the beginning.

  


</p></li><li>Sort <tt>points</tt> by x-coord and by y-coord using system
<tt>qsort</tt>. To do this first allocate two new arrays: 

<pre>point2D *points-by-x, *points-by-y; 
//allocate them of size  ndp, copy data from points then sort them 
</pre>


<p>You need to use system qsort for this by defining appropriate comparison
functions.

</p></li><li> Call a helper function 

<pre>
kdtree_build_rec(point2D* points-by-x, point2D* points-by-y, int ndp, ...)
 
</pre>
This helper function should build the kd-tree recursively. It should
probably take the depth of the current node as a parameter and use it to
decide whether to split vertically or horizontally. 


<p>The main challenge in this function will be to catch all the cases that
  can happen and make sure the recursion stops. 

</p><p>In case of an even number of points, the median should be either a
point in between the two medians; or the smaller of the two medians --- in
this case make sure you include the point on the line in the tree to the
left or below, in order to avoid infinite recursion.  Stop the recursion
when the node contains 1 point (and perhaps earlier if necessary).



</p></li><li>Finding the median: The median is the value in the middle index of the
sorted array (sorted by x or by y, depending on the type of node). All
points that are smaller or equal (in x or y) go on one
side  and the rest on the other. Because points can have same coordinates,
it can be that more than  half points go on the left side ---- you'll need
to count and see precisely how many. 

<p> It's possible that all points go on one side. 

 For e.g. consider the points

</p><pre>(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)</pre>

examined in the x-coordinate. Middle point is (3,6). But the third's
point x-value is also 3, so it will go on the left side. Thus this
passes the entire array to the next level. Then we examine them in the
y-coordinate:

<pre>(3,5), (3,6), (2,6)</pre>

Middle point is (3,6). But the third point has same y-coord as the
median, which means it will also go on the left side. Thus this passes
entire array to next level again, i.e. infinite recursion. These
points are not coincident but are collinear in just the wrong way to
cause infinite recursion (example thanks to Rob).

<p>You'll need to find a way to deal with this. 

</p></li><li>Splitting <tt>points-by-x</tt> and <tt>points-by-y</tt> and passing
them through the recursion: the easiest way is to first do a pass and count
precisely how many points go left and how many right, then allocate the new
arrays and then do another pass and copy the points.  Do not try to
optimize passes, first make your code as simple and make it WORK.  Leave
optimizing for later. 

<p></p></li><li>Freeing up memory: don't forget to free the arrays that you are done
with (C has no garbage collection!). 

</li></ul>

<b>Testing:</b> It goes without saying that you need to throroughly test
your code.  Testing is a crucial step in the code development
cycle. The goal of testing is to find bugs.  Try to break your
code. Once you find a bug, <b>try to reproduce it on the smallest
possible input</b> ---- it's no fun debugging on an input of half a
million points.

<p>To test your kd-tree, run it on sets of random points with
values of n ranging from 1,2,3,4,5,...to 1000000. For each value of n
press the space bar to get a different set of random points.

For small values of n you'll want to start by printing the entire
tree.  Once your code works for small n, you'll probably want to
switch to just printing the info of the kd-tree (number of nodes and
height).

Write a few different functions for initialization (in addition to <tt>initialize_points_random()</tt>), for example
</p><pre>//initializes array points with n points on a horizontal line 
void initialize_points_case1() {
..
}

//initializes array points with n points on a vertical line 
void initialize_points_case2() {
..
}

//initializes array points with 3 points as in the example above
//that may trigger infinite recursion
void initialize_points_case3() {
   n=3;
   ..
}

</pre>


<hr>
<h2>Part 2: Rendering the kd-tree</h2>

Write a function that renders the kd-tree in OpenGL.  
Use the code for the previous assignments.  The OpenGL part  is
pretty easy --- basically
<pre>//for each node in the tree in some order {

      glBegin(gl_LINE);
      //identify the endpoints p1 and p2 of the line segment that you
      //need to draw
      glVertex2f(p1);
      glVertex2f(p2); 
      glEnd(gl_LINE);
}
</pre>

The harder part in the rendering is identifying the endpoints of the
line segment for that node. Note that the line <tt>x=x1</tt>through
the root is infinite in the y-direction.  The lines in the nodes left
and right of the root are infinite on one side, and bounded by
<tt>x=x1</tt> on the other side. And so on. The region corresponding
to a node (and thus the endpoints of the segments that will split it)
can be computed based on the ancestors of the node in the tree.

<p>The input points are generated in the range [0,WINDOWSIZE] x [0,
WINDOWSIZE]. Thus a value of infinity in x or y direction should be
set to WINDOWSIZE.


</p><p>Needless to say, develop your code gracefully. Start by drawing
infinite lines through all nodes, then refine it to compute the
proper segment.


</p><hr>
<h2>Part 3: </h2>

<hr>
<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Make sure that your code is C (C99 standard) and not C+, for
e.g. you shoudl NOT have
</p><pre>for (int i=0; i&lt; ...);
</pre>
As handy as it is to write loops like this, it is not standard C
style.  If in doubt, compile your code on dover.  If your code
compiles, you are all set.  If not, fix it!






<p>Enjoy!
